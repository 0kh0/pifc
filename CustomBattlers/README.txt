These are the thousands of community-made custom sprites for Pokémon Infinite Fusion! Put the .png files in the Graphics\CustomBattlers folder and the game will automatically use them in place of the machine-generated sprites from http://pokefusion.japeal.com
***
The Doubles folder contains all the sprites for which there are multiple options. Maybe someone made two versions of a fusion. Maybe two people did a version of the same fusion. Maybe seven different people made a sprite for Charbasaur. Delete the ones you don't like, remove the letter from the end of the remaining sprites' filenames, and move them into CustomBattlers, overwriting what's already there.

The subfolders of the Other folder:
-Jokes contains a bunch of sprites you can put into CustomBattlers. Some of them are silly, or look like other pokémon, or other Digimon, or beloved comics pioneer Stan Lee.
-Alternate Sprites contains mostly unfused pokémon sprites, many of which were drawn from scratch for use as a base for a fusion sprite. There are also a few alternate sprites for the handful of triple-fusions that may appear late in the game.
-Double-Fusions contains sprites for fusions of two of the same pokémon. There's a bit of conceptual overlap with the Jokes folder.
-Animated Sprites are animated versions of existing custom sprites. They move around whenever they're onscreen.
-Pictures contains sets of images that go in Graphics\Pictures (or Icons, where indicated) instead of Graphics\Custom Battlers. You can replace the same-named files already there if you prefer these. 
-Eggs contains files that go in Graphics\Battlers\Eggs
-Windowskins contains files that go in Graphics\Windowskins
-Characters contains files that go in Graphics\Characters
-Titles contains files that go in Graphics\Titles
-Alternate Trainers contains sets of files to completely replace your trainer's appearance. The files are sorted by which folder they go in. Note that the game does not actually use trback100.png and trback101.png at time of writing.
